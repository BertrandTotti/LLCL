  "body": "Light LCL (LLCL)\r\n================\r\n\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n  The Light LCL (LLCL) is intended to provide a way to produce\r\nsmall executable files with Free Pascal/Lazarus or Delphi 7,\r\nwhile being compatible with - a part of - the LCL/VCL. It may\r\nconcern for instance: small installation or configuration\r\nprograms, simple tools, test programs, ... Typically, the size\r\nis about 1/10th with Free Pascal/Lazarus and 1/5th with Delphi\r\nfor small and simple programs.\r\n\r\n  It's not a specific graphical library, or another widgetset.\r\nIt's an emulation of a small subset of the standard LCL/VCL,\r\nfor only the most basic controls and classes, with their most\r\ncommon properties, methods and events. Of course, it implies\r\nthat only the controls and properties present in the Light LCL\r\ncan be used.\r\n\r\n  It is based upon the Very Light VCL (LVCL) of Synopse for Delphi 7:\r\n[LVCL](https://github.com/synopse/LVCL)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage and configuration\r\n\r\n  There is nothing to install in order to use it, nor any\r\nconfiguration to modify: just indicate a valid path for the\r\nLight LCL files into your project options, and that's it !\r\n\r\n  It's available only for Windows (32 and 64 bits). It has\r\nbeen tested with FPC 2.6.x/3.x + Lazarus 1.4.x/1.6 and\r\nDelphi 7.\r\n\r\n  See \"README.txt\" for more pieces of information.\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n  The Light LCL is released under the Mozilla Public License\r\nversion 2.0. See \"LICENSE.txt\".\r\n\r\n\r\n## LLCL ChangeLog\r\n\r\n* [Version 1.02] (https://github.com/FChrisF/LLCL/releases/tag/v1.0.2):\r\n\r\n  Main changes and additions:\r\n  - TRadioGroup control added (not enabled by default),\r\n  - TRegistry class added (Registry.pas),\r\n  - TClipboard: SetAsText bug fix,\r\n  - TStringGrid: ColCount and RowCount bug fix,\r\n  - bug fixes when application was starting and closing,\r\n  - bug fixes and non standard ItemStrings property removed\r\n    for internal TCustomBox class,\r\n  - TForm: ShowModal bug fix (with several modal forms),\r\n  - DeleteFile and RenameFile added (SysUtils), and also\r\n    DeleteFileUTF8 and RenameFileUTF8 (FileUtil/LazFileUtils),\r\n  - internal TMemoLines et TBoxStrings classes (for TMemo and\r\n    TComboBox/TListBox controls) modified for a better LCL/VCL\r\n    compatibility (data accessing).\r\n\r\n* [Version 1.01] (https://github.com/FChrisF/LLCL/releases/tag/v1.0.1):\r\n\r\n  Main changes and additions:\r\n  - TStringGrid control added (Grids.pas),\r\n  - TIniFile class added (IniFiles.pas),\r\n  - TClipboard class added for text data (ClipBrd.pas),\r\n  - PNG images support (not enabled by default),\r\n  - transparent bitmaps support (not enabled by default),\r\n  - forms double buffering support (not enabled by default),\r\n  - TSelectDirectoryDialog control added (Dialog.pas) for\r\n    FPC/Lazarus (not enabled by default) and SelectDirectory\r\n    function (Dialog.pas or FileCtrl.pas),\r\n  - ANSI LLCL option (i.e. no UTF8 at all) added for\r\n    FPC/Lazarus (see in LLCLFPCInc.inc),\r\n  - design time only properties for controls are now\r\n    accessible for dynamic creation purposes. Run time\r\n    modifications are still not supported for them, but they\r\n    can now be set at run time before the corresponding\r\n    control is dynamically created,\r\n  - a few bug fixes and some minor additions/modifications.\r\n\r\n  Note: controls and functionalities not enabled by default\r\n  can be activated by defining the corresponding option(s) in\r\n  the option files LLCLOptions.inc.\r\n\r\n* [Version 1.00] (https://github.com/FChrisF/LLCL/releases/tag/v1.0.0):\r\n  - Initial public release.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Samples\r\n\r\n  A small demonstration project (both for Free Pascal/Lazarus\r\nand Delphi 7) is included.\r\n\r\n[![Demonstration screenshot](captures/demo-screen-th.png)](captures/demo-screen.png)\r\n\r\n  More sample projects are also available here:\r\n[Sample projects for the LLCL](https://FChrisF.github.io/LLCL-samples)\r\n",
