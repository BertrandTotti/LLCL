{"name":"Llcl","tagline":"LLCL - FPC/Lazarus Light LCL","body":"Light LCL (LLCL)\r\n================\r\n\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n  The Light LCL (LLCL) is intended to provide a way to produce\r\nsmall executable files with Free Pascal/Lazarus or Delphi 7,\r\nwhile being compatible with - a part of - the LCL/VCL. It may\r\nconcern for instance: small installation or configuration\r\nprograms, simple tools, test programs, ... Typically, the size\r\nis about 1/10th with Free Pascal/Lazarus and 1/5th with Delphi\r\nfor simple small programs.\r\n\r\n  It's not a specific graphical library, or another widgetset.\r\nIt's an emulation of a small subset of the standard LCL/VCL,\r\nfor only the most basic controls and classes, with their most\r\ncommon properties, methods and events. Of course, it implies\r\nthat only the controls and properties present in the Light LCL\r\ncan be used.\r\n\r\n  It is based upon the Very Light VCL (LVCL) of Synopse for Delphi 7:\r\n[LVCL](https://github.com/synopse/LVCL)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage and configuration\r\n\r\n  There is nothing to install in order to use it, nor any\r\nconfiguration to modify: just indicate a valid path for the\r\nLight LCL files into your project options, and that's it !\r\n\r\n  It's available only for Windows (32 and 64 bits). It has\r\nbeen tested with FPC 2.6.x/3.x + Lazarus 1.2.x/1.4.x/1.5 and\r\nDelphi 7.\r\n\r\n  See \"README.txt\" for more pieces of information.\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n  The Light LCL is released under the Mozilla Public License\r\nversion 2.0. See \"LICENSE.txt\".\r\n\r\n\r\n## LLCL ChangeLog\r\n\r\n* [Version 1.00] (https://github.com/FChrisF/LLCL/releases/tag/v1.0.0):\r\n  - Initial public release.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Samples\r\n\r\n  A small demonstration project (both for Free Pascal/Lazarus\r\nand Delphi 7) is included.\r\n\r\n[![Demonstration screenshot](captures/demo-screen-th.png)](captures/demo-screen.png)\r\n\r\n  More sample projects are also available here:\r\n[Sample projects for the LLCL](https://github.com/FChrisF/LLCL-samples)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
